## Installation

### How do I install WebStack Installer?

Quick install:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joogiebear/webstack-installer/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed instructions.

### How long does installation take?

- Initial system setup: 5-10 minutes
- Adding a domain: 2-3 minutes
- Email server setup: 5-7 minutes

### Can I install on an existing server?

Yes, but it's recommended to use a fresh server to avoid conflicts. The installer checks for existing services before proceeding.

### What if installation fails?

Check the error message and system logs:
```bash
sudo tail -50 /var/log/syslog
```

```

To completely remove the stack, manually uninstall Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

---

## Domain Management

### How many domains can I host?

Unlimited! Limited only by your server resources (RAM, CPU, disk space).

### How do I add a second domain?

Run the installer again:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/webstack-installer.sh
```

It detects the existing installation and adds the new domain.

### Can I host subdomains?

Yes! Treat subdomains like regular domains when installing.

### How do I remove a domain?

```bash
sudo ./scripts/remove-domain.sh
```

This removes all files, databases, and configurations.

### Where are my website files located?

```
/var/www/usr_USERNAME/public_html/
```

Replace `USERNAME` with your domain's username (found in info.txt).

### How do I access phpMyAdmin?

Each domain gets a unique phpMyAdmin URL with a random path for security. Find it in:
```bash
sudo cat /root/webstack-sites/example.com/info.txt
```

### Can I use different PHP versions per domain?

Yes! Use the update script:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/update-domain.sh
```

Select option 2 to change PHP version.

### How do I view domain credentials?

```bash
sudo ./scripts/domain-info.sh example.com
```

Or directly:
```bash
sudo cat /root/webstack-sites/example.com/info.txt
```

### Can I change database passwords?

Yes, use the update script:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/update-domain.sh
```

Select option 3 to regenerate the database password.

## Troubleshooting

### Website shows "Apache2 Default Page"

The site isn't enabled. Run:
```bash
sudo a2ensite example.com
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

### "403 Forbidden" error

Permission issue. Fix with:
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/usr_USERNAME/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/usr_USERNAME/public_html/
```

### Database connection fails

1. Check MySQL is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

2. Verify credentials:
```bash
sudo cat /root/webstack-sites/example.com/info.txt
```

3. Test connection:
```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name
```

### SSL certificate won't install

Common causes:
1. **DNS not pointing to server** - Wait for propagation
2. **Port 80 blocked** - Check firewall
3. **Domain not accessible** - Verify Apache is running

Test:
```bash
curl -I http://example.com
```

### "500 Internal Server Error"

Check Apache error log:
```bash
sudo tail -50 /var/www/usr_USERNAME/logs/error.log
```

Common causes:
- PHP syntax errors
- .htaccess issues
- Permission problems
- Missing PHP modules

### phpMyAdmin "Access Denied"

Use database credentials from info.txt, NOT system user password.

### Email not sending

1. Check mail logs:
```bash
sudo tail -50 /var/log/mail.log
```

2. Test mail server:
```bash
echo "Test" | mail -s "Subject" you@example.com
```

3. Check mail queue:
```bash
sudo postqueue -p
```

### High memory usage

Check processes:
```bash
top
```

Optimize:
- Disable unused Apache modules
- Tune MySQL configuration
- Enable PHP OPcache
- Use caching (Redis/Memcached)

### Disk space full

Find large files:
```bash
sudo du -sh /* | sort -hr | head -10
```

Clean up:
```bash
# Remove old logs
sudo find /var/log -type f -name "*.log.*" -delete

# Clean package cache
sudo apt clean

# Remove old backups
sudo rm -rf /root/backups/old_backup_*
```

---

## Performance

### How do I optimize performance?

1. **Enable caching** (Redis, Memcached)
2. **Use HTTP/2**
3. **Enable Gzip compression**
4. **Optimize images**
5. **Use a CDN**
6. **Enable PHP OPcache**

### Can I use Nginx instead of Apache?

The installer is built for Apache. For Nginx, you'll need to modify the scripts or use them as reference.

### How many concurrent visitors can I handle?

Depends on:
- Server resources (RAM, CPU)
- Website optimization
- Caching configuration
- Database efficiency

A typical 2GB RAM server can handle:
- 100-500 concurrent visitors (static sites)
- 50-200 concurrent visitors (dynamic sites)

### Should I use a CDN?

Yes, for production sites with traffic. CDNs improve:
- Page load speed
- Global availability
- Bandwidth costs
- Server load

Popular CDNs:
- Cloudflare (free tier available)
- Amazon CloudFront
- BunnyCDN
- StackPath
